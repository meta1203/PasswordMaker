PasswordMaker
=============

Uses a keyphrase and the name of a website to generate random passwords for individual sites. Fixes my bad habit of reusing passwords across websites.

Uses an SHA-256 javascript library from http://caligatio.github.com/jsSHA/

**2023-09-17 - Breaking Change!**

While this thing has served me well for the last several years, it unfortunately had a few
shortcomings that made it a pain to use in some instances. As of 2023-09-17, the default
password generation strategy now does two additional things that may result in slightly
different passwords than those made by the previous generation strategy:

- Any password generated that happens to lack a special character will now have an exclamation
mark (!) appended to generated password. This guarantees that any generated password will have
a special character.
- The website field now automatically strips spaces ( ). This means that any mis-typed names
will be correctly identified as a domain name (ex. "HBO Max.com" -> "hbomax.com")

The previous strategy has been deprecated, and *may be removed at some point in the future*.
It is highly recommended that you update any passwords that differ from the ones generated by the new strategy.
